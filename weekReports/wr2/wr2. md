# Lecture 2 Introduction to Linux Notes

## Important concepts:
* **Operating System:An operating system provides all fundamental software features of a computer. **

* **Kernel:An OS kernel is a software component that's responsible for managing low-level features of a computer.**

* **Components of an operating system:Hardware, Linux Kernel, Daemons & Shells, Graphical Desktop Environment,Applications**

* **Linux :Linux is a Unix-like Operating System popular in academic and business environments**

* **Linux Characteristics:Open Source software, free of charge, inc. many Unix tools, highly customizable, applicable on almost any system**

* **GNU Toolchain:is a collection of compilers, libraries, debuggers, and core utilities modelled on Unix.**

* **Linux Distribution:a complete system package.**
 
* **What is Ubuntu:A Linux distribution freely available with both community and professional support**

* **Ubuntu Release cycles:Ubuntu is shipped in stable and regular release cycles; Regular or Non-LTS every six months and supported for 9**

* **What is Debian:An all volunteer organization dedicated to developing free software**

* **Different software licensing models (open source vs closed source):open source: source code distributed with the software  closed source: User is restricted from modifying the source code. **

* **The 4 Freedoms of Free Software:Freedom 0: Use the software for any purpose Freedom 1:Examine the source code and modify it as you see fit Freedom 2: redistribute the software. Freedom 3: Redistribute your modified software**

* **Virtualization:Tech that you can use to create virtual representations of servers, storage, networks, and other physical machines**

* **Hypervisor and types:type 1 : runs directly on the host machine's physical hardware, known as bare-metal hypervisor. Type 2 : runs on the operating system of the physical host machine, hence, call hosted hypervisors**

* **VirtualBox:cross platform virtualization software. allows users to extend their existing computer to run multiple operating systems including Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and Oracle Solaris at the same time.**
